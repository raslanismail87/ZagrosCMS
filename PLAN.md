## Success Criteria

Each task should result in:
1. **Working functionality** that can be demonstrated
2. **Passing tests** for the implemented features
3. **Updated documentation** for new features
4. **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

## Development Guidelines

### Library Research and Implementation
**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any library or framework feature, always use the Context7 MCP tool to get the latest information about:

- **Current best practices** for the specific library version being used
- **Latest API changes** and migration guides
- **Implementation examples** and patterns
- **Common pitfalls** and solutions
- **Performance recommendations**

**Process for using Context7:**
1. Identify the library/framework you need to work with (e.g., "SQLAlchemy", "FastAPI", "Next.js")
2. Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to get the correct library ID
3. Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` with specific topics/queries
4. Apply the latest patterns and recommendations to your implementation

**Examples:**
- Before setting up SQLAlchemy models: Query Context7 for "SQLAlchemy 2.0 async patterns"
- Before implementing FastAPI authentication: Query Context7 for "FastAPI JWT authentication best practices"
- Before creating Next.js components: Query Context7 for "Next.js 14 app router patterns"

This ensures our implementation follows current best practices and avoids deprecated patterns.

## Technology Decisions Rationale

- **FastAPI**: High performance, automatic API documentation, Python ecosystem
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, excellent developer experience, React ecosystem
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with JSON support for flexible schemas
- **SQLAlchemy**: Mature ORM with excellent PostgreSQL support
- **JWT**: Stateless authentication suitable for API-first architecture

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-database support (MySQL, MongoDB)
- GraphQL API generation
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced workflow management
- Multi-language content support
- Advanced SEO features
- Performance analytics dashboard
